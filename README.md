Dash Stock Project

When I originally built the Stocks site with Angular, my intent was to include a stock chart. I found Dash and decided to give it a try! Since then, the site that I utilized for retrieving stock market information has changed and now requires an API key to retrieve stock chart information for any stock other than Apple (AAPL). So, I just retrieved information for Apple instead of Google.
